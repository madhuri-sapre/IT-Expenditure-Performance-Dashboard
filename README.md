# Project Title
IT-Expenditure-Performance-Dashboard


# Description 
An interactive Excel dashboard analyzing IT expenditure with insights on Actual vs Plan vs Forecast, YTD variances, cost trends, and business/IT area performance. Includes slicers and KPIs for clear financial decision-making.



# Overview
This project presents an interactive IT Expenditure Dashboard built using Microsoft Excel.
It helps track and analyze IT spending, compare Actual vs Plan, evaluate Year-to-Date (YTD) variances, and monitor performance across Business Areas, IT Areas, Regions, and Cost Elements.
The dashboard supports decision-makers by identifying overspending, underspending, cost trends, and key variance contributors.
